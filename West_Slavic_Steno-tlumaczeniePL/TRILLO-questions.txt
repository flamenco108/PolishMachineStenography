Hello Priscilla!
I hope you are feeling well now.

I have some questions to you according to Stenography Manual and word creation methods. I put them below. But first I would like to ask: 

How proficient should I be in doing certain exercise to move forward to the next exercise?
I still train 1, 2 and 3. Perhaps I could tap faster, but right now - I don't know. My fingers more or less remember, where are the keys. Sometimes I make mistakes with `-S` and `-T`. And still I don't like thumb-keys, I loose position of thumbs. I'm going to put some stickers on `I` keys, maybe when they will have different feel, I will not mistake them.

### As posted on Discord, the same below:

```
bzd ZTP*
bzdr ZTPRJ*
bzdrz ZTPR
```

According to "logic" it should be:
```
bzd ZTP*
bzdr ZTPR
bzdrz ZTPRJ*
```
I consider it a typo

### Page 33 section "Something about J"

JIAU >>> EIAU

Then you write: `This modification only affects the following consonant and Y
combination: BY, DY, DZY, GY, and HY.`
Then below (next and next etc. section) you show that:
```
ż = TPJ

dż = PVJ

rz = RJ (and so brz, drz, grz...)

but also

br, gr, hr, żr
```
BUT here comes another rule which allows me to switch between y and i, when it's undoubtedly, like:
```
rzy/ży = RJI/TPJI

bry/gry/hry/żry = BRI/
```
Right?

### Different `Y` and surroundings (page 32-37)

Does it concern voiced sounds? And so:

```
py ➠ PIAU 	by ➠ PEIAU
ty ➠ TIAU 	dy ➠ TEIAU
ky ➠ KIAU 	gy ➠ KEIAU
cy ➠ ZSIAU	dzy ➠ ZSEIAU whatabout ZSI (as dzi ➠ ZSJI)
chy ➠ KTIAU	hy ➠ KTEIAU whatabout KTI (as hi ➠ KTJI)?
szy ➠ TPIAU 	ży ➠ TPEIAU but TPI (and TPJI as above)
czy ➠ PVIAU 	dży ➠ PVEIAU but PVI (and PVJI as above)
```

It looks like I could use it as a rule:

**If there is key-goup `(x)J` (anything+J) and I want to voice it by `y`, then I can do it always this way: `(x)EIAU` although sometimes I can do it also another way.**

considers to:
```
b - PJ
d - TJ
dź - TJ~ (non existent but in shortcuts)
dz - ZSJ
dż - PVJ
g - KJ
h - KTJ
ł - LJ
ń - LRJ (non existent but in shortcuts)
rz - RJ
ś - SJ (non existent but in shortcuts)
```
and consonant groups ending on above

I ask this question for our scripting purposes for creation of dictionaries.

(I still train first exercises, but I see that in near future I will need at least a basic dictionary to be able to train next exercises)

So, what is your opinion? Technically `EIAU` is work-around, when it is impossible to play with `IAU` and use just `I` instead. 
But if both options are stuck in dictionaries, a possible typing error will not result in a display error.

Logic of words creation. 

suffixes (Page 154)

```
ba = XFPJA
by = XFPJY or XFPEIAU
```

suffixes (Page 174):

```
by = XFPEIAU or XFPJY
bym = XFPEIAUCS
byś = XFPEIAUSO
byście = XFPEIAUSTO
byśmy = XFPEIAUCSOY
```

And rules for tertiary vowels (as Page 260):

```
a = XZ
e = XK
i = XP
o = XL
u = XZK
y = XZP

```
But I don't see similar words `aby, abym, abyś, abyście, abyśmy`. So can I creatively cheat and do it this way (they are words, not suffixes):

```
aby = XZPEIAU (aby) or shortcut XZEIAU (ay) or XZY (ay)
abym = XZPEIAUCS (abym) or shortcut XZEIAUCS (aym)
abyś = XZPEIAUSO (abyś) or shortcut XZEIAUSO (ayś)
abyście = XZPEIAUSTO (abyść) or shortcut XZEIAUSTO (ayść)
abyśmy = XZPEIAUCSOY (abyma) or shortcut XZEIAUSOY (ayma)
```

I know, it's sort of overlapping.

(of course here's question for `byśmy = XFPEIAUCSOY` - why it is now `byśmy = XFPEIAUCSY` when `any = ZKPLACLY` and `emy = ZKPLECSY`? Perhaps should it be in both variants?)

### The way of creating words (word-roots) in general

Having tertiary, primary and secondary vowels, as well as two groups of consonants (left and right), we have a huge potential of creation word roots, even when they are multisyllables.
Should we look for a solution that results in fewer chords each time, or should we look for the most universal chords?

E.g. core "chod":

If it is universal, then we try to use it in various situations as:

`chod-nik, chod-ak, chod-aczek, chod-acz(e)k-owy` 

but also 

`roz-chod-ni-aczek, chod-(dz)ik, chod-(z)ę, chod-(z)my, chod-(z)imy, roz-chod-niacz(e)k...`

But I can also create 3 word roots:

```
chod >> chod-ak, chod-nik, chod-aczek
chodz >> chodz-ę, chodz-imy, chodz-my, chodz-ik
chodn >> roz-chodn-aczek, chodn-(i)k,
```

Above is just a lame example based on yours.

Which approach is better/correct?

----------

### Working on word-pieces

In the consonant groups of the right side are lacking as below (and my propositions deduced from other examples):

```
rś  RSO
rsi RSW
rtw RW (RTW?)
rzch CRBG (like chrz rzk)

```

You assigned `BSG` to `ż` and to `żb`, but there are similar words that differ this way eg. `wróż` and `wróżb`, so my proposition is to assign `żb` where also `żw` are assigned: `BSGW` which does not effect conflict.

-------------

### Brackets

I see that `{  KTPV-LBSG` and `[  KTPV-LBSG`, but `}  ZSKT-SGTW` and `]  KTPV*LBSG` - is it planned and if yes (I see the same in the table on page 302 and in Lessons), why? Do you expext that computer will retrospectively translate `[ or {` to apropriate forms based on their closing versions?
